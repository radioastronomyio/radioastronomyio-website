# RadioAstronomy.io Website Brief

RadioAstronomy.io Website is the public-facing website for the radioastronomyio GitHub organization. It presents the organization's computational astronomy research, DESI-based projects, and the underlying infrastructure that enables the work.

This website exists to provide a professional, accessible entry point for visitors discovering the organization — whether from academic collaboration, GitHub exploration, or general interest. It showcases six active repositories spanning galaxy evolution research, quasar physics, ML-driven spectral analysis, and enterprise-grade research infrastructure.

The primary audience includes astronomers and researchers interested in collaboration, data engineers exploring reproducible workflows, infrastructure engineers interested in the platform architecture, and general visitors curious about accessible astronomical computing. The site should communicate scientific credibility while remaining approachable to non-specialists.
