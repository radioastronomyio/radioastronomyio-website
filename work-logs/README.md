## 3. Milestone Structure

Each milestone directory contains:

```
XX-milestone-name/
├── README.md           # Objectives, status, outputs
├── *.html/css/js       # Work artifacts (if applicable)
├── figures/            # Screenshots, diagrams
└── validation/         # Test results, checklists
```

## 4. Repository Status

This repository has reached its stable state. The site is live at [radioastronomy.io](https://radioastronomy.io), the code is documented with dual-audience comments, and the README serves as a reference implementation for spec-driven static site development.

Future changes will be minor maintenance. Significant updates would spawn a new worklog (04+).
