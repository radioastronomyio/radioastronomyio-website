This repository contains the public website for the [radioastronomyio](https://github.com/radioastronomyio) GitHub organization — a 9-page static site showcasing computational astronomy research projects, infrastructure documentation, and data science methodologies. The site was built as an open experiment in spec-driven development, demonstrating how AI coding agents can transform a detailed specification into production-ready code with minimal manual intervention.

## 📋 Spec-Driven Development

The core idea: write a complete specification before any code exists, then hand it to an AI coding agent.

![spec-driven-development-process](assets/spec-driven-devleopment-process-infographic.jpg)

### The Specification Document

We created [`docs/website-reference.md`](docs/website-reference.md) containing:

| Section | Contents |
|---------|----------|
| Visual style guide | Color palette, typography, card styles (derived from existing graphics) |
| Navigation structure | Page hierarchy, dropdown behavior, mobile patterns |
| Complete page content | Every heading, paragraph, and section for all 9 pages |
| Technical requirements | SEO meta tags, structured data, accessibility notes |

The spec was ~2,000 words covering everything needed to build the site without ambiguity.

### AI Agent Execution

We used [Antigravity](https://www.antigravity.dev/) (Flash tier) with the spec as input. The agent:

- Built all 9 HTML pages with content from the spec
- Created CSS with custom properties matching the style guide
- Implemented JavaScript for navigation, scroll effects, animated counters, lightbox, and collapsibles
- Added Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags
- Generated sitemap.xml

Total agent execution time: ~15 minutes over 4 iterative prompts of increasing difficulty.

### Manual Refinement

Some CSS adjustments were made interactively with Claude:

| Adjustment | Reason |
|------------|--------|
| Banner width 100% → 80% | Full-width felt visually heavy |
| Container width % → fixed px | Proper zoom behavior |
| Spacing xl → lg | Tighter visual rhythm |

These refinements took ~15 minutes of iterative discussion and testing.

## 🎨 Visual Identity with Nano Banana 3

All graphics (banners, hero images, infographics) were created using [Nano Banana 3](https://www.nanobanana.com/), an AI image generator that excels at style consistency through reference images.

![visual-identity-workflow](assets/visual-identity-workflow-with-nano-banana-3-infographic.jpg)

### The Workflow

Step 1: Create a base banner

We started with one repository banner, iterating a few times until the style was right — graph paper background, steel blue (#5B8FAE) primary color, coral (#E8A87C) accents, illustrated infographic elements.

Step 2: Use the base as a style reference

For subsequent banners, the prompt was simple:

> The attached images are repository banners for a set of repositories under a single GitHub org at <https://github.com/radioastronomyio>. They are styled, colored, themed, and aspect ratio'd similar. I need a new repository banner in the same style based off the attached readme. We will be doing several banners in this same style in this chat.

Then for each additional repository:

> Repeat the last process for this new readme.

That's it. NB3's style transfer capabilities maintained visual consistency across all 6 repository banners plus the org hero image and infographics.

## ☁️ Azure Static Web Apps

Azure Static Web Apps (SWA) is a fully managed hosting service for static websites. It handles SSL certificates, global CDN distribution, and continuous deployment from GitHub — all automatically.

![azure-static-web-apps-hosting](assets/azure-static-web-apps-managed-hosting-infographic.jpg)

### What Static Web Apps Supports

SWA works with any static site generator or framework:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| No build step | Plain HTML/CSS/JS (what we used) |
| JavaScript frameworks | React, Vue, Angular, Svelte |
| Static site generators | Hugo, Jekyll, Gatsby, Astro, Next.js (static export) |
| Other | Blazor WebAssembly, any SPA |

For sites with no build step, Azure simply serves files directly from your repository.

### Free Tier Allowances

The free tier is generous for personal/hobby projects:

| Resource | Allowance |
|----------|-----------|
| Bandwidth | 100 GB/month |
| Storage | 250 MB per app (500 MB total) |
| Custom domains | 2 |
| Staging environments | 3 |
| SSL certificates | Free (auto-managed) |
| CDN | Global edge distribution |
| Apps per subscription | 10 |

If you exceed 100 GB bandwidth, the site stops serving until the next billing cycle — no surprise charges.

### How It Works

1. You push code to a GitHub repository
2. A GitHub Action (auto-generated) builds and deploys to Azure's CDN
3. Your site is live at `<random-prefix>.azurestaticapps.net`
4. Optionally, add a custom domain with automatic SSL

No servers to manage, no infrastructure to configure.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure for Azure SWA

Azure SWA needs to know where your deployable content lives. For no-build sites, the key is the `app_location` setting in your GitHub Action workflow.

### Two Common Patterns

Option A — Content at repository root:

```
my-website/
├── index.html
├── about.html
├── css/
├── js/
└── assets/
```

Workflow config: `app_location: "/"`

Option B — Content in a subdirectory (what we use):

```
my-website/
├── src/                    # Deployable content
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── css/
│   ├── js/
│   └── assets/
├── docs/                   # Not deployed
├── work-logs/              # Not deployed
└── README.md               # Not deployed
```

Workflow config: `app_location: "/src"`

Option B keeps deployment content separate from documentation and development artifacts.

## 🚀 Creating the Azure Static Web App

### Step 1: Create the Resource

1. Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Search for "Static Web Apps" → Create
3. Fill in:
   - Subscription: Your Azure subscription
   - Resource group: Create new or use existing
   - Name: Your app name (becomes part of the default URL)
   - Plan type: Free
   - Region: Closest to your primary audience
4. Under "Deployment details":
   - Source: GitHub
   - Sign in and authorize Azure to access your repositories
   - Organization/Repository/Branch: Select your repo and main branch
5. Under "Build Details":
   - Build Presets: Custom
   - App location: `/src` (or `/` if content is at root)
   - API location: Leave empty (no serverless functions)
   - Output location: Leave empty (no build step)

Click "Review + Create" → "Create"

### Step 2: What Happens Next

Azure automatically:

1. Creates a GitHub Action workflow file in your repository (`.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-*.yml`)
2. Adds `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN` to your repository secrets
3. Triggers the first deployment

Within 1-2 minutes, your site is live at `https://<prefix>.azurestaticapps.net`.

### The Generated Workflow

For a no-build static site, the key settings in the workflow are:

```yaml
app_location: "/src"       # Where your HTML files live
output_location: ""        # Empty — no build output
skip_app_build: true       # Optional but recommended
```

## 🌍 Custom Domain Setup

The free tier supports custom domains but with one constraint: CNAME only (no A record option). This works fine with most DNS providers.

### Our Setup

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Domain | radioastronomy.io |
| DNS Provider | Cloudflare (free plan) |
| Records | Proxied through Cloudflare |

### Step-by-Step

Step 1: Add custom domain in Azure

1. In Azure Portal, navigate to your Static Web App
2. Go to "Custom domains" in the left sidebar
3. Click "Add" → "Custom domain on other DNS"
4. Enter your domain (e.g., `radioastronomy.io`)

Step 2: Verify ownership with TXT record

Azure provides a TXT record value for verification:

| Type | Name | Value |
|------|------|-------|
| TXT | `_dnsauth` | (Azure-provided verification string) |

Add this record in your DNS provider. Verification usually completes within a few minutes.

Step 3: Add CNAME records

Once verified, add CNAME records pointing to your Azure URL:

| Type | Name | Target |
|------|------|--------|
| CNAME | `@` | `<prefix>.azurestaticapps.net` |
| CNAME | `www` | `<prefix>.azurestaticapps.net` |

> Note: Some DNS providers don't support CNAME at the apex (`@`). Cloudflare does via CNAME flattening.

Step 4: Enable proxying (Cloudflare)

If using Cloudflare, set the proxy status to "Proxied" (orange cloud) for both records. This provides additional CDN caching and DDoS protection.

Step 5: Wait for propagation

DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate globally, though it's usually much faster (minutes to a few hours). Once propagated, Azure automatically provisions an SSL certificate for your custom domain.
